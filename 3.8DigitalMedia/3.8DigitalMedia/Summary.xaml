"/><LineBreak/><Run Text="With roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock, and acid rock, heavy metal bands developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and loudness. The lyrics and performances are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo."/><Run Text=" "/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals. Heavy metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes. The New York Times critic Jon Pareles writes, &quot;In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock—the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.&quot; The typical band lineup includes a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, a lead guitarist, and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist. Keyboard instruments are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound. Deep Purple's Jon Lord played an overdriven Hammond organ. In 1970, John Paul Jones used a Moog synthesizer on Led Zeppelin III; by the 1990s, in &quot;almost every subgenre of heavy metal&quot; synthesizers were used."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="The electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal. The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy fuzz. For classic heavy metal guitar tone, guitarists maintain gain at moderate levels, without excessive preamp or pedal distortion, to retain open spaces and air in the music; the guitar amplifier is turned up loud to produce the characteristic &quot;punch and grind&quot;. Thrash metal guitar tone has scooped mid-frequencies and tightly compressed sound with multiple bass frequencies. Guitar solos are &quot;an essential element of the heavy metal code ... that underscores the significance of the guitar&quot; to the genre. Most heavy metal songs &quot;feature at least one guitar solo&quot;, which is &quot;a primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity&quot;. Some exceptions are nu metal and grindcore bands, which tend to omit guitar solos. With rhythm guitar parts, the &quot;heavy crunch sound in heavy metal ... [is created by] palm muting&quot; the strings with the picking hand and using distortion. Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="The lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional &quot;frontman&quot; or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two &quot;contend for dominance&quot; in a spirit of &quot;affectionate rivalry&quot;. Heavy metal &quot;demands the subordination of the voice&quot; to the overall sound of the band. Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an &quot;explicit display of emotion&quot; is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity. Critic Simon Frith claims that the metal singer's &quot;tone of voice&quot; is more important than the lyrics."/><LineBreak/><Run Text=" "/><LineBreak/><Run Text="The prominent role of the bass ‍is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element. The bass provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music &quot;heavy&quot;. The bass plays a &quot;more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock&quot;. Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's Cliff Burton with his heavy emphasis on bass ‍solos and use of chords while playing the ‍bass in the early 1980s. Lemmy of Motörhead often played overdriven power chords in his bass lines."/><LineBreak/><Run Text=" "/><LineBreak/><Run Text="The essence of heavy metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the &quot;trifecta of speed, power, and precision&quot;. Heavy metal drumming &quot;requires an exceptional amount of endurance&quot;, and drummers have to develop &quot;considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity ... to play the intricate patterns&quot; used in heavy metal. A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music. Black metal, death metal and some &quot;mainstream metal&quot; bands &quot;all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats&quot;."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run/></TextBlock>

One of these experimental examples introduced to modern metal was djent. The music typically showcases the extreme technical proficiency of the performers and usually uses unorthodox harmonies as well as complex rhythms with frequent meter changes and intense syncopation."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="One of the hallmark musical qualities of progressive metal is the stylistic eclecticism that is pervasive across many groups. In between the riffs, choruses, and solos typical of rock and metal songs, prog metal bands often include sections inspired by jazz, classical, Middle Eastern music (especially often using the phrygian dominant scale), Dixieland, ragtime, among others. This is usually achieved by the keyboard player of the band playing unique sounds or by including instruments that are unorthodox for metal, such as the saxophone. The idea of incorporating different styles of music was primarily pioneered by Dream Theater; this approach is seen throughout most of their discography. Other groups that frequently use these eccentric sections include Haken, Between the Buried and Me, Thank You Scientist, Opeth, Liquid Tension Experiment, and Circus Maximus."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Progressive metal is difficult to define specifically, since most bands labeled under the genre have considerably different musical influences when compared to each other. For example, two bands that are commonly identified as progressive metal, King's X and Opeth, sound very different from one another; King's X is greatly influenced by hard rock, whereas Opeth's growling vocals and heavy guitars lead to the band being cited as progressive death metal."/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Similarly, bands such as Dream Theater, Planet X, Puya, Liquid Tension Experiment, The Faceless, Between the Buried and Me and Animals as Leaders have a jazz influence, with extended solo sections that often feature &quot;trading solos&quot;. Cynic, Atheist, Opeth, Pestilence, Between the Buried and Me and Meshuggah all blended jazz fusion with death metal, but in dramatically different ways. Devin Townsend draws on more ambient influences in the atmosphere of his music. Progressive metal is also often linked with power metal; Fates Warning and Conception, two bands that were originally power metal outfits, later incorporated progressive elements that ended up overshadowing their power metal roots. The ProgPower music festivals showcase this progressive/power metal fusion. Recently, with a popularity in shred guitar, the genre of &quot;technical metal&quot; has become increasingly prevalent and popular. This has led to a resurgence of popularity for more traditional progressive metal bands like Dream Theater and Symphony X; it also has led to the inclusion within the progressive niche of bands that do not necessarily play in its traditional style such as thrash/power metal band Nevermore and technical death metal pioneers Necrophagist and Obscura. These bands are often labeled progressive since they play complex and technical music which does not fall under any other genre."/><LineBreak/><Run Text=" "/><LineBreak/><Run Text="In the late 2000s, bands such as Born of Osiris, Periphery, Tesseract, Animals as Leaders and Vildhjarta popularized the &quot;djent&quot; style of progressive metal in a sound originally developed by Meshuggah. It is characterized by high-attack, palm-muted, syncopated riffs (often incorporating polymeters), as well as use of extended range guitars. Extended range guitars also feature in other forms of progressive metal; artists including Devin Townsend, Dir En Grey, and Ne Obliviscaris have used 7-string guitars without being part of the &quot;djent&quot; movement."/><LineBreak/><Run Text=" "/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Proyecto Eskhata, a Spanish band, has received much press coverage in Spain for its fusion of progressive rock and rap metal, which journalists have described as &quot;progressive rap metal&quot;."/><LineBreak/><Run Text=" "/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Progressive doom is a fusion genre that combines elements of progressive metal and doom metal.

Vocals in groove metal usually are yelling, growling, screaming, or very raspy singing. Although groove metal has a big emphasis on guitar riffs, guitar solos are still very common.

Generally, power metal is characterized by a faster, lighter, and more uplifting sound, in contrast with the heaviness and dissonance prevalent, for example, in extreme metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally &quot;powerful&quot; sound."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Power metal is highly focused on the vocalist, with &quot;clean&quot; vocals being much more prevalent than the growling vocals often associated with extreme metal. Inspired by Ronnie James Dio, Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford, Geoff Tate, and other rock and heavy metal vocalists, power metal vocals are often in a high register, and the singer's vocal range is usually wide. The majority of the genre's vocalists sing in the tenor range and are capable of hitting very high notes, for example Timo Kotipelto of Stratovarius, Tony Kakko of Sonata Arctica, Michael Kiske (Helloween) and Andre Matos (ex-Angra). "/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Themes that frequently feature throughout other metal subgenres, such as religion and politics, are comparatively rare in power metal - albeit not unheard of. Power metal's lyrical themes often focus on fantasy and mythology, camaraderie and hope, personal struggles and emotions, war and death, or combinations of the aforementioned. For example, Finnish band Sonata Arctica have been known for focusing their lyrics of their songs on fantasy but also have many songs based on reality, love and relationships."/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Many power metal bands based their concept albums on fantasy books and national epics; Blind Guardian based Nightfall in Middle-Earth on Tolkien's The Silmarillion, while Kamelot based Epica and The Black Halo on Goethe's Faust. Some bands have even written their own imaginary stories, like Rhapsody of Fire's Emerald Sword Saga and The Dark Secret Saga, Iced Earth's Something Wicked Saga, or Avantasia by Edguy's Tobias Sammet."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Historical themes have also seen usage in the works of bands, most famously Sabaton, whose lyrics extensively focus on historical wars, battles, and individuals that received notable recognition for their wartime accomplishments. Examples include World War I, World War II, Vikings, Samurai, and much more from around the world including the American, Swedish and German militaries. Serenity, an Austrian (symphonic) power metal band, focuses mainly on historical figures and events, including Sir Francis Drake, Marco Polo, Galileo, Beethoven, and Napoleon."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Power metal guitarists and bassists generally play rapid streams of notes, but change chords comparatively slowly, with a harmonic tempo of once per measure or slower. Fast and technically demanding guitar solos, however, are almost guaranteed.[13] The slow changing of chords is significant in defining power metal just as the fast rapid chord changes often define traditional thrash metal. Power metal often makes use of Major chord progressions as well as circle progressions. Some of the most influential and acclaimed power metal guitarists are Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray, Michael Weikath of Helloween, and Timo Tolkki formerly of Stratovarius. It is a common trait in power metal for the bass guitar to take a back seat, so to speak; often simply providing the chord root notes and being drowned out by the more prevalent rhythm guitars. However, some power metal bands incorporate bass that is more audible with colorful patterns distinct from the rhythm guitars, such as Helloween, Hibria, and Symphony X."/><LineBreak/><Run/></TextBlock>

The three major methods of harsh vocalization used in the genre are often mistaken for each other, encompassing vocal fry screaming, false chord screaming, and &quot;true&quot; death growls. Growling is sometimes also referred to as Cookie Monster vocals, tongue-in-cheek, due to the vocal similarity to the voice of the popular Sesame Street character of the same name. Although often criticized, death growls serve the aesthetic purpose of matching death metal's aggressive lyrical content. High-pitched screaming is occasionally utilized in death metal, being heard in songs by Death, Aborted, Exhumed, Dying Fetus, Cannibal Corpse, and Deicide."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="The most popular theory of the subgenre's christening is Possessed's 1984 demo, Death Metal; the song from the eponymous demo would also be featured on the band's 1985 debut album, Seven Churches. Possessed vocalist/bassist Jeff Becerra said he coined the term in early 1983 for a high school English class assignment. Another possible origin was a magazine called Death Metal, started by Thomas Fischer and Martin Ain of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. The name was later given to the 1984 compilation Death Metal released by Noise Records. The term might also have originated from other recordings, such as the demo released by Death in 1984, called Death by Metal."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run/></TextBlock>

Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal. During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands such as Witchfinder General from England, American bands Pentagram, Saint Vitus, the Obsessed, Trouble, and Cirith Ungol, and Swedish band Candlemass defined doom metal as a distinct genre."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="The electric guitar, bass guitar, and drum kit are the most common instruments used to play doom metal (although keyboards are sometimes used), but its structures are rooted in the same scales as in blues.

Along with the usual heavy metal compositional technique of guitars and bass playing the same riff in unison, this creates a loud and bass-heavy wall of sound. Another defining characteristic is the consistent focus on slow tempos, and minor tonality with much use of dissonance (especially in the form of the tritone), employing the usage of repetitive rhythms with little regard to harmonic progression and musical structure."/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Traditional doom metal vocalists favor clean vocals, which are often performed with a sense of despair, desperation, or pain; imitating the high-tone wails of Ozzy Osbourne (Black Sabbath), Frank Ferrara (Bang), Bobby Liebling (Pentagram), and Zeeb Parkes (Witchfinder General).

Influenced by notable blues musicians like Robert Johnson and Son House, normally they are gloomy and pessimistic, including themes such as suffering, depression, fear, grief, dread, death, and anger.

The influence of these bands has been acknowledged by the likes of gothic metal bands Within Temptation, Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, Celestial Season and Saturnus.

While loud and heavily distorted electric guitars are a core feature of all metal genres, nu metal guitarists took the sounds of &quot;violence and destruction&quot; to new levels with their overdriven guitar tone, which music journalists Kitts and Tolinski compared to the &quot;...sound [of] a Mack truck being crushed by a collapsing skyscraper.&quot; "/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Some nu metal bands use seven-string guitars that are generally down-tuned, rather than traditional six-string guitars. Likewise, some bass guitarists use five-string and six-string instruments. Bass guitar-playing in nu metal often features an emphasis on funk elements. In nu metal music, DJs are sometimes featured to provide instrumentation such as sampling, turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds. Nu metal tends to have hip hop grooves and rhythms."/><Run Text=" "/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Lyrics in nu metal songs are often angry or nihilistic; many of the genre's lyrics focus on topics such as pain, angst, bullying, emotional issues, abandonment, betrayal, and personal alienation, in a way similar to those of grunge. Many nu metal lyrics that are about these topics tend to be in a very direct tone. However, some nu metal songs have lyrics that are about other topics. P.O.D. have used positive lyrics about promise and hope. The nu metal song &quot;Bodies&quot; by Drowning Pool is about moshing. The Michigan Daily wrote about Limp Bizkit's lyrics, writing that the band &quot;used the nu-metal sound as a way to spin testosterone fueled fantasies into snarky white-boy rap. Oddly, audiences took frontman Fred Durst more seriously than he wanted, failing to see the intentional silliness in many of his songs&quot;. Limp Bizkit's lyrics also have been described as misogynistic. Dope's lyrics are usually about sex, drugs, parties, women, violence and relationships. In contrast, according to Josh Chesler of the Phoenix New Times, the lyrics of Deftones, who were once considered a nu metal band, &quot;tend to have complex allusions and leave the songs open to many different interpretations.&quot;"/><Run Text=" Nu metal clothing typically consists of baggy pants, shirts, and shorts, JNCO jeans, Adidas tracksuits, sports jerseys, baseball caps, baggy hoodies, cargo pants, and sweatpants. Nu metal hairstyles and facial hairstyles include dreadlocks, braids, spiky hair, chin beards, bald heads, goatees, frosted tips, and bleached or dyed hair. Common accessories in nu metal fashion include wallet chains, tattoos, and piercings,especially facial piercings. Nu metal fashion has been compared to hip hop fashion."/><LineBreak/><Run Text=" "/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Some nu metal bands such as Motograter, Mushroomhead, Mudvayne, and Slipknot wear masks, jumpsuits, costumes, face paint, corpse paint or body paint.

However, the band did not coin the term itself; the djent scene developed from an online community of bedroom musicians, including Misha Mansoor, whose success with Periphery brought djent &quot;from the virtual world into the real one&quot;. In a 2018 interview by Rauta, Meshuggah guitarist Mårten Hagström jokingly apologized for the band's role in creating the djent genre. On how the name &quot;djent&quot; originated he explained, &quot;It was our lead guitar player, Fredrik, being drunk back in the day, talking to one of our old-school fans, trying to explain what type of guitar tone we were always trying to get, and he was desperately trying to say: 'We want that 'dj—' 'dj—,' 'dj—,' 'dj—.'

An example is the song &quot;Cafo&quot; by Animals as Leaders. It typically features heavily distorted, palm-muted guitar chords, syncopated riffs, and poly-meters alongside virtuosic soloing.

Post-metal band Rosetta is noted as saying, &quot;Maybe we should start calling doom metal 'DUNNN'&quot;. In response to a question about 'djent,' Lamb of God vocalist Randy Blythe stated in 2011, &quot;There is no such thing as 'djent;' it's not a genre.&quot; Deftones guitarist Stephen Carpenter similarly opined in 2016 that &quot;I thoroughly can get djent, I even have great appreciation for the bands, and I mean Meshuggah is one of my favorite bands.
